# Project Description
According to a 2019 Google / Harris Poll, 24% of Americans have used common passwords, like abc123, Password, and Admin. Even more concerning, 59% of Americans have incorporated personal information, such as their name or birthday, into their password. This makes it unsurprising that 4 in 10 Americans have had their personal information compromised online. Passwords with commonly used phrases and personal information makes cracking a password drastically easier.


# Aims and Objectives
The aim of this project is to write a script to analyze a company's employees logins and identify which employees need to chnage their passwords; due to a recent data breach.
